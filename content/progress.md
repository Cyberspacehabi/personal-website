# Progress

Thoughts on how we make things better.

## Why Progress Matters

Progress isn't inevitable. It requires intention, effort, and the right conditions. Understanding what enables progress helps us create more of it.

## Historical Examples

Some cases of rapid progress worth studying:

- **The Apollo Program** (1961-1969) - From Kennedy's speech to the moon in 8 years
- **The Manhattan Project** (1942-1945) - Unprecedented coordination of science and engineering
- **The Green Revolution** (1960s-1970s) - Agricultural innovations that fed billions
- **mRNA Vaccines** (2020) - Decades of research enabling rapid pandemic response

## What Enables Progress?

Patterns I've noticed:

- **Urgency** - Clear deadlines and high stakes focus effort
- **Talent density** - Great people attract and elevate each other
- **Resources** - Adequate funding without bureaucratic overhead
- **Autonomy** - Freedom to pursue unconventional approaches
- **Feedback loops** - Rapid iteration and learning

## What Inhibits Progress?

- Excessive regulation and compliance burden
- Short-term thinking in funding and incentives
- Risk aversion in institutions
- Coordination failures between disciplines
- Loss of ambition and belief that progress is possible

## Questions I'm Exploring

- Why did progress seem faster in some eras?
- What institutional forms best support innovation?
- How do we balance caution with ambition?
- Can we deliberately create conditions for breakthroughs?
